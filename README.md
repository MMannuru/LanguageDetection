-Developed language detection system with python, scikit-learn, and numpy using Kernelized Support Vector Machines and achieved over 95% accuracy

-Created feature matrix with TF-IDF vectorization (n-grams ranging from 1-3) to train SVM with linear kernel to find optimal hyperplane in high-dimensional space and utilized One Vs Rest strategy to train 40 different binary classifiers for multi-class classification

The code for this project is in this repo
